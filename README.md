### 🌟 About Me

I'm a passionate Full Stack Software Engineer with a knack for building cloud-native applications and scalable systems. My expertise spans React, Node.js, TypeScript, and both GCP and AWS platforms. Whether it's architecting robust backends, creating intuitive UIs, or automating the CI/CD process, I thrive on transforming ideas into impactful software.

Outside of code, you'll find me dancing to Ray Barretto or studying Thelonious Monk. I believe creativity powers both great code and great music.
